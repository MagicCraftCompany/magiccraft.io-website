          <p>
            At MagicCraft, we respect your privacy and are committed to
            protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy
            outlines our practices for collecting, using, maintaining,

          <p>
            Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our
            policies and practices regarding your information and how we
            will treat it. By accessing or using our Services, you agree

            changes. Therefore, we encourage you to review this Privacy
            Policy periodically for updates.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>b. Non-Personal Information:</strong> Non-personal information refers to any information that cannot be used to directly identify you as an individual.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>c. Information from Third-Party Sources:</strong> We may also obtain information about you from third-party sources, such as social media platforms or other third-party services, when you choose to link or connect your MagicCraft account with those platforms or services. The information we receive from these third-party sources may include your name, username, profile picture, email address, and any other information you have made publicly available or have authorized the third party to share with us. We may combine this information with the personal and non-personal information we collect directly from you to help personalize and improve your experience with our Game and Services.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>b.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>c. Cookies and Tracking Technologies:</strong> We use various tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies, to collect information about your use of our Game and Services, to improve the user experience, and to personalize content and advertising. Cookies are small data files stored on your device that help us recognize you and remember your preferences. Web beacons (also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs) are small transparent images embedded in web pages, emails, or other communications that help us track your interactions with our Game and Services. You can control the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser settings, but please note that some features of our Game and Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.
          </p>

            We may also work with third-party service providers, such as analytics and advertising partners, who use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect information about your use of our Game and Services and to provide personalized advertising based on your interests. Some of these third-party service providers may participate in industry frameworks, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), which provide tools for opting out of targeted advertising.

            We retain your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including to provide our Game and Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. The specific retention period for your information may vary depending on the nature of the information and the purposes for which it was collected. When your information is no longer required for these purposes, we will securely delete or anonymize it in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>b. Security:</strong><br/>

          </p>
          <p>
            To help maintain the security of your account and personal information, we recommend that you use a strong and unique password, enable any available security features, such as two-factor authentication, and regularly update your account information.
